You gave me more knowledge in less than 3 months than my University did in 3 years.</p> <p>2024 training participant 3</p> <p>I really liked the approach to the topics from scratch, i.e. the trainers' explanation of even the simplest issues. This allowed me to understand the issues despite the fact that I\u2019m not a student heavily involved in IT. I also liked the fact that almost every topic was taught by a different person, which meant that even though the course was on a Saturday and lasted for several hours at a time, it was not tedious and tiring.</p> <p>2024 training participant 4</p> <p>The course is a huge dose of knowledge, it was clear that the topics are presented to us by passionate people.</p> <p>2024 training participant 5</p> <p>Thanks a lot for organizing the course! Starting I expected the usual average course dry theory, etc. and here surprise, a group of enthusiasts creating an amazing training. The whole course was conducted in a very engaging and interesting way with a huge amount of knowledge. You showed in a very accessible way how Cybersecurity is a broad area, how many areas related to it can be developed and how many nooks and crannies of this field I have to discover :) As for the form of the course itself, it was accessible and conducted in an interesting way, but a nice addition would have been the opportunity for me to meet you ;)</p> <p>2024 training participant 6</p> <p>In my opinion, each presentation was very professionally prepared and had a large amount of information that was new to me. In addition, I think it is very difficult to find the golden mean between the amount of material and the range of topics, so I realize that the course could have been overwhelming. However, for me, it was perfect, allowing me to learn about many areas of such a vast topic as cybersecurity and the behind-the-scenes work in this field.</p> <p>2024 training participant 7</p> <p>You are cybersecurity professionals, I would enjoy live meetings/laboratories at your company. It would be a good idea to introduce such a series in the next edition of the course.</p> <p>2024 training participant 8</p> <p>The entire course is very interesting and expands knowledge, giving a solid pill of information.</p> <p>2024 training participant 9</p> <p>I really enjoyed this whole course. I\u2019ve found all the lectures interesting even though I wasn\u2019t so sure about it at the beginning (if I chose the right one for me), this course quickly proved me wrong. Above all that, all the trainers seemed very passionate about their subjects and the information they gave us. It was a pleasure to be a part of this project.</p> <p>2024 training participant 10</p> <p>The course was really enjoyable and I will remember it well, I learned a lot of things that will certainly be useful to me in the future.</p> <p>2024 training participant 11</p> <p>I would rate the classes conducted at 5+, because of the instructors and topics.</p> <p>2024 training participant 12</p> <p>First of all, I would like to thank you all very much for conducting the course. It was, for the most part, interesting, thought-provoking and thought-provoking about the day-to-day work in IT. I listened to you, often with my daughter, who later told at school how to 'hack people through the ceiling' based on the presentation about red teams :)</p> <p>2024 training participant 13</p> <p>Very interestingly conducted course, I learned a lot of new issues. Without the knowledgeable people at ING, it would have been difficult on my own. I sincerely thank you for the opportunity to participate.</p> <p>2024 training participant 14</p> <p>It is impossible to improve the course, because in my opinion it is perfect ;) I liked everything, I learned a lot. I would be happy to participate in the next part. Thank you for the opportunity to participate :)</p> <p>2024 training participant 15</p> <p>I found the course to be very well constructed and with interestingly selected materials. Even a person who has no contact with the subject can learn a lot, especially through contact with many professionals in this field.</p> <p>2024 training participant 16</p> <p>The course was very interesting, varied and in the form it was fine, while I would have preferred the classroom, because on remote it is harder for me to focus.</p> <p>2024 training participant 17</p> <p>I loved the course! I\u2019m really happy I had the chance to take part in it because my studies are not in the field of IT and I wanted to learn more about cybersecurity. I\u2019m very grateful to everyone who dedicated their time into this course. I learned a lot, I\u2019m happy it was more introductory beacuse otherwise I wouldn\u2019t understand anything :)) (still some things were confusing to me but that\u2019s probably because of my lack of IT background). The classes were very interesting, I have my favourites, and I would definitely recommend this course to everyone wanting to take their first step into cybersecurity, whether they have an education in IT already or not. All the teachers were very nice and open to questions, I think it was also cool to see the \"vibe\" in relations in ING Hubs Poland which was very friendly. I\u2019m also happy this course wasn\u2019t just 10 hours, because you can\u2019t learn much in that time.</p> <p>2024 training participant 18</p> <p>The course is time-consuming, but very much worth it. Cybersecurity is my field of study, so I was already familiar with some topics, nevertheless I still could find the course interesting and find out about some new things. I would say that opportunity to meet (despite the remote characteristic of the course) people that work in Cybersecurity field and have day-to-day experience with it was the best aspect of the course (friendly attitude was also a great and encouraged interaction with participants). Even if someone was familiar with presented topics, having hands-on experience and perhaps a chance to get to know new solutions was enough to compensate for it.</p> <p>2024 training participant 19</p> <p>Overall the course was very informatory, and it was clear that people teaching/presenting the topics have broad knowledge in their field.</p> <p>2024 training participant 20</p> <p>The course was very well conducted. The trainers had a lot of knowledge and were willing to share it with the participants. The atmosphere was very good and encouraged learning new things.</p> <p>2024 training participant 21</p> <p>I think that the current form of the course is perfect. The only improvement could be the onsite classes and getting to know you personally, but this is my subjective opinion :) The number of classes and their scope is sufficient, you can really get a lot of knowledge from them if you are fully focused on the class. Thanks to you, I know that a career in cybersecurity is written for me and I no longer have any resistance to change my career path. Maybe I\u2019ll see you again someday! ;)</p> <p>2024 training participant 22</p> <p>I really liked this course. It aligned exceptionally well with my current pursuit of knowledge from the cybersecurity field as I was able to learn something new as well as to revise the previously learnt information. The lecturers were always passionate about the topic they were presenting, which helped with the learning process.</p> <p>2024 training participant 23</p> <p>It is perfect :)</p> <p>2024 training participant 24</p> <p>I am very pleased and sincerely thankful that I could participate in the course. This training allowed me to look at different departments of Cybersecurity and consolidate my knowledge in this area and also gave me motivation for further learning. This is an industry in which I would like to grow. I am very grateful for the time and preparation for the training. Each of the people put a lot of heart in the preparation and a great plus was that so many people conducted the training so that I could catch something from each presenter. The current number of hours of the course I think is sufficient. The diversity of the material also appealed to me and I think that the course conducted in its current form is fine.</p> <p>2024 training participant 25</p> <p>Overall great, I really like that there were multiple presenters. It definitely broadened my perspective and outlook on the complexity of the cybersecurity topic.</p> <p>2024 training participant 26</p> <p>As a beginner, I found the course well-prepared and appreciated the opportunity to interact with the instructors. I was hoping for more hands-on activities/simulation exercises, but I am still satisfied.</p> <p>2024 training participant 27</p> <p>CRC 2024 Cybersecurity course for me was very informative and covered a lot of cybersecurity topics. It was very interesting to see the corporate point of view and discover many difficult challenges that you are taking day by day. I really appreciated this course - good job. Thank you!</p> <p>2024 training participant 28</p> <p>The course was really great and thanks to it, I consolidated some issues in the broader field of cybersecurity. I will definitely participate in future editions.</p> <p>2024 training participant 29</p> <p>The course was very informative and substantive, I learned many new things and sorted out what I want to study further. I enjoyed the overview of all possible areas in Cybersecurity and the professionals delegated to us showed the highest level. Thank you. The test was quite challenging.</p> <p>2024 training participant 30</p> <p>I really enjoyed the course. I gained a lot of knowledge from it. As a person fascinated by OSINT and the legal side of data protection in IT systems, I really enjoyed the modules on OSINT and Data Protection. I hope that you will do even more courses, for even more people, because it was really apparent how committed you all are and with what passion you pass on knowledge. :)</p> <p>2024 training participant 31</p> <p>I liked the course, it was full of unique information.</p> <p>2024 training participant 32</p> <p>I have positive impressions about the course content.</p> <p>2024 training participant 33</p> <p>I feel that this course has expanded my knowledge significantly. The lectures were interesting and substantive.</p> <p>2024 training participant 34</p> <p>Whole course was exceptional with its lectures and topics.</p> <p>2024 training participant 35</p> <p>Really great course, a lot of different presenters and every lecture on the high level, so I\u2019m impressed that they managed to orchestrate it this way, thanks a lot for the opportunity to participate.</p> <p>2024 training participant 36</p> <p>Great classes conducted. A big plus is looking at different perspectives of the cybersecurity world.</p> <p>2024 training participant 37</p> <p>Course was very nice and I have learned a lot of new things. For somebody who is not connected to the field (my studies are in finance and do not offer any subject related to cybersecurity) it required a lot of additional work. Sometimes there were classes that I felt like the presenter went from 0 to 100 in a matter of few slides skipping all the \"middle knowledge\". After all I\u2019m really pleased by this course and I have achieved my goal by participating.</p> <p>2024 training participant 38</p> <p>I really liked it. I have gained a lot of knowledge that would be useful in my future career.</p> <p>2024 training participant 39</p> <p>The cybersecurity course allowed me to fill a number of knowledge gaps, which can definitely be counted as a plus.</p> <p>2024 training participant 40</p> <p>The presenters, very substantive and in an accessible way, conducted their lectures. You could see the full professionalism and the contribution they made to the preparation of the topics. What I liked about the course was that the presenters asked several questions a day or two before the class. It was thought-provoking, and it definitely improved the quality and caused there to be more discussion in a given class. I enjoyed it very much, warm greetings and many thanks! May there be more such courses!</p> <p>2024 training participant 41</p> <p>I think the course has shown me the interior of the Cybersecurity environment. Back in the past, before the course, I had been learning things about Cybersecurity on my own, and it had been hard to search for the point to start with. I am satisfied and happy that I could be a part of that course and I wish you the best next years. Thank you!</p> <p>2024 training participant 42</p> <p>Interesting course conducted by interesting people. Awesome opportunity that I was able to take part in it :)</p> <p>2024 training participant 43</p> <p>Well organized, informative course.</p> <p>2024 training participant 44</p> <p>Mass of knowledge imparted in a great way.</p> <p>2024 training participant 45</p> <p>The course was sensational, the amount of knowledge imparted in the course was incredibly great and valuable.</p>"},{"location":"crc/2025/","title":"CRC 2025 edition","text":""},{"location":"crc/2025/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"Number of hours 45 hours Number of meetings 8 meetings, 8 Saturdays Form of meeting on-line Schedule 2025-03-01 09:00 \u2013 16:00 +0100 (CET) DAY 1/82025-03-08 09:00 \u2013 16:00 +0100 (CET) DAY 2/82025-03-15 09:00 \u2013 16:00 +0100 (CET) DAY 3/82025-03-22 09:00 \u2013 16:00 +0100 (CET) DAY 4/82025-03-29 09:00 \u2013 16:00 +0100 (CET) DAY 5/82025-04-05 09:00 \u2013 16:00 +0200 (CEST) DAY 6/82025-04-12 09:00 \u2013 16:00 +0200 (CEST) DAY 7/82025-04-26 09:00 \u2013 16:00 +0200 (CEST) DAY 8/82025-05-10 10:00 \u2013 11:00 +0200 (CEST) FINAL EXAM"},{"location":"crc/2025/#topics","title":"Topics","text":"# Topic Trainer 1 Kickoff meeting \u0141ukasz Jankowski ,Damian Krawczyk  2 Cyber awareness S\u0142awomir Staciwa  3 Data Protection -
