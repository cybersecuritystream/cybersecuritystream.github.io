    The course was conducted at a high standard in an interesting way. It guides us through the various levels of CyberSec, as well as gives us the opportunity to acquire new and helpful knowledge, mainly theoretical, which gives us the opportunity to get acquainted with various levels of the industry and helps us decide what is most interesting to us and in what direction we would like to develop. Everyone will find something for themselves, whether a newcomer, unfamiliar with the subject, or even an intermediate who wants to expand their knowledge. I recommend and thank you for the opportunity to participate, it was interesting :)

!!! quote "2023 training participant 13"

    It’s great that ING Hubs give a possibility to broaden their horizons in an eld of Cybersecurity for students without work experience. I am very happy I could participate in this course and see a little bit of every area. I’m looking forward to other courses conducted by your company! :)

!!! quote "2023 training participant 14"

    I think that the course is something completely transformative for me, as somebody coming from more of a software development background because that is what I did as a hobby and part of learning new technologies, mainly web technologies. I was always interested in technologies related to security. I used Kali Linux in the past to do some basic pentesting at home with an old router. And when attending this course, I was able to learn information that made me realize how broad and interesting the field of security is in IT. The professionalism of the presenters and the depth at which the topics were explained, along with very interesting practical elements, made it so that I believe I want to actively use the skills learned here in my career in the future. To sum up, it was a very positive experience.
